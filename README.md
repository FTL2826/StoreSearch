# StoreSearch
Guided by Fahim Farook's &amp; Matthijs Hollemans's UIKit apprentice
There are three views. First one is for search purposes (searchBar, toolBar, table for results) made fully by Storyboard&Xib tools. Second one for item detail info (push modally, hover over first one) made by using storyboard tools and autolayout. Finally third one view for landscape mode of app. Landscape view controller is child for first one, created by storyboard, however frames and information are added via code. Also there are some animations for show or hide views.
In project I use URLSession for network job with iTunes.com.
App is localized for Base(English) and Russian languages.
App support any/dark appearences.
